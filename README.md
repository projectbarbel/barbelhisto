# barbelhisto

A lightweiht easy to use bullet proof library to store the history of changes to domain objects in two dimensional format.

The library implements Martin Fowlers Temporal Pattern that can be found here: https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/timeNarrative.html

# Who will need barbelhisto?

Whe you use barbelhisto to store an read data you can find answers to these questions:

- What was the state of my domain object two weeks ago?
- What will be the state of my domain object in two weeks?

Even more complicated:

- Two month ago, what did we know about the state of domain objects six month ago?
- Two month ago, what did we know about the state of domain objects in four months?

This library enables you to store your data in a format that enables you to answer these questions.
